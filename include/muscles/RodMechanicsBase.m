classdef RodMechanicsBase
    % Base class of any rod mechanics model
    % A rod mechanics model encompasses how an elastic rod behaves on its
    % own. Thus it may include any of the following:
    % - Neutral length
    % - Force produced as a function of strain/pressure (force-surface).
    % - Linear stiffness
    % - Bending stiffness
    % - Stiffness matrix
